# OPTIMIZING STOCK TRADING STRATEGY WITH REINFORCEMENT LEARNING  

👉🏻 **A personal project focused on applying Reinforcement Learning for stock market trading optimization.**  

## Project Overview  

This project explores how Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be applied to develop an intelligent stock trading strategy.  
The goal is to design an agent that learns from historical stock price data and optimizes buy/sell/hold decisions to maximize long-term returns.  

Key steps in the project include:  

- **Data Collection & Preparation**: Using multi-year stock price datasets, cleaning, and feature engineering.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns, correlations, and market trends.  
- **Modeling Approaches**:  
  - Stock price prediction using machine learning models.  
  - Reinforcement Learning agent trained to simulate trading decisions.  
- **Strategy Optimization**: Balancing risk and reward, comparing RL-based strategies against baseline methods.  
- **Visualization & Insights**: Tracking portfolio growth, rewards, and model performance over time.  

## Key Features  

- Implementation of Reinforcement Learning algorithms for stock trading.  
- Stock price trend forecasting with machine learning models.  
- Comparative evaluation of different strategies.  
- Visual dashboards and performance plots to monitor trading outcomes.
